Feature: Phase 6 ft status
  `ft status` provides scenario status management and project reporting.
  Without arguments it displays a high-level project report (scenario counts
  grouped by status). With `<id> <status>` it sets a scenario's status.
  This phase also updates `ft show` to display status history and `ft list`
  to show current status from the database and support filtering.

  Background:
    Given the user has run `ft init`

  @ft:57
  Scenario: Set a scenario status
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 accepted`
    Then  a new status record is inserted for scenario 1 with status "accepted"

  @ft:58
  Scenario: Status accepts @ft: prefix
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    When  the user runs `ft status @ft:1 in-progress`
    Then  a new status record is inserted for scenario 1 with status "in-progress"

  @ft:59
  Scenario: Status accepts any text as status
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 my-custom-status`
    Then  a new status record is inserted for scenario 1 with status "my-custom-status"

  @ft:60
  Scenario: Status for unknown ID returns error
    Given no scenario exists with id 999
    When  the user runs `ft status 999 accepted`
    Then  the command fails with an error containing "999"

  @ft:61
  Scenario: Multiple status changes create history
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 accepted`
    And   the user runs `ft status 1 in-progress`
    Then  there are two status records for scenario 1
    And   the most recent status is "in-progress"

  @ft:62
  Scenario: Project report with no scenarios
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  the output contains "Scenarios: 0"

  @ft:63
  Scenario: Project report counts scenarios by status
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with scenarios "User logs in" and "User fails login"
    And   fts/checkout.ft has been synced with Scenario "User completes purchase"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    And   the user has set scenario 2 to "in-progress"
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  the output contains "Scenarios: 3"
    And   the output contains "accepted" with count 1
    And   the output contains "in-progress" with count 1
    And   the output contains "no-activity" with count 1

  @ft:64
  Scenario: Project report shows no-activity last
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   no status has been set for the scenario
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  "no-activity" appears last in the status list

  @ft:65
  Scenario: Project report orders statuses by count descending
    Given several scenarios with varying statuses
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  statuses are listed in order of count, most common first
    And   "no-activity" appears last regardless of count

  @ft:66
  Scenario: Status requires init
    Given the user has not run `ft init`
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 accepted`
    Then  the command fails with "run `ft init` first"

  @ft:67
  Scenario: Status with no arguments and no id returns report
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  the output contains "Scenarios:"
    And   no error is returned

  @ft:68
  Scenario: Show displays current status from database
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft show 1`
    Then  the output contains "Status: accepted"
    And   the output does not contain "no-activity"

  @ft:69
  Scenario: Show displays status history
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "in-progress"
    When  the user runs `ft show 1`
    Then  the output contains "History:"
    And   "in-progress" appears before "accepted" in the history
    And   each history entry has a timestamp

  @ft:70
  Scenario: Show with no status still shows no-activity
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   no status has been set for the scenario
    When  the user runs `ft show 1`
    Then  the output contains "Status: no-activity"
    And   the output does not contain "History:"

  @ft:71
  Scenario: List shows current status from database
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft list`
    Then  the output contains "accepted"
    And   the output does not contain "no-activity"

  @ft:72
  Scenario: List filters by status flag
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with scenarios "User logs in" and "User fails login"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    And   the user has set scenario 2 to "in-progress"
    When  the user runs `ft list --status=accepted`
    Then  the output contains "User logs in"
    And   the output does not contain "User fails login"

  @ft:73
  Scenario: List filters by no-activity flag
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with scenarios "User logs in" and "User fails login"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft list --no-activity`
    Then  the output contains "User fails login"
    And   the output does not contain "User logs in"

  @ft:74
  Scenario: Status update requires both id and status arguments
    When  the user runs `ft status 1`
    Then  the command fails with an error about missing arguments

  @ft:75
  Scenario: Status update prints confirmation
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 accepted`
    Then  the output contains "@ft:1"
    And   the output contains "accepted"

  @ft:76
  Scenario: Project report omits zero-count statuses
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  the output contains "accepted"
    And   the output does not contain "in-progress"
    And   the output does not contain "done"
    And   the output does not contain "blocked"

  @ft:77
  Scenario: List filter with no matches returns empty output
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft list --status=done`
    Then  the output is empty
    And   no error is returned

  @ft:78
  Scenario: Report requires init
    Given the user has not run `ft init`
    When  the user runs `ft status`
    Then  the command fails with "run `ft init` first"

  @ft:79
  Scenario: Show history uses human-readable timestamps
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft show 1`
    Then  the history timestamp uses the format "Jan 2, 2006 3:04pm"
    And   the timestamp does not use ISO 8601 format

  @ft:80
  Scenario: Show history aligns timestamps across rows
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "in-progress"
    When  the user runs `ft show 1`
    Then  the timestamp column starts at the same position on every history row

  @ft:81
  Scenario: Status update confirmation shows previous status
    Given fts/login.ft has been synced with Scenario "User logs in"
    And   the user has set scenario 1 to "accepted"
    When  the user runs `ft status 1 in-progress`
    Then  the output contains "accepted → in-progress"
    And   the output contains "@ft:1"
